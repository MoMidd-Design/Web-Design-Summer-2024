          <p>Among my creations, this piece stands out as one of the most distinctive. It showcases a novel technique I acquired using Blender, specifically 3D modeling and rendering. These figures, intended to display three characters wearing hoodie merchandise, were designed for the brand I worked for, NRATED. While everything was created in Blender, text and certain illustrations, such as the graphite mark in the background, were vectorized through Photoshop and then incorporated into the artworks.​​​​​​​</p>
