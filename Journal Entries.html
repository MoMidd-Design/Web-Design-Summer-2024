        <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201108174738/http://www.ursulakleguinarchive.com/Note-Technology.html">Link To Article</a></li>
        <p>Ursula K. Le Guin's essay "A Rant About Technology" delves into the definition of true technology in the context of modern innovation. Le Guin highlights the intricate relationship between technology and the development of culture and societies among human populations. She views technology as a means to an end, allowing people to adapt to their surroundings and environments, ultimately "coping with physical reality." Le Guin emphasizes the distinction between hi-tech and general technology, arguing that the simplicity of a tool does not diminish its capabilities or value. She encourages us to appreciate and learn from all forms of technology.</p>

         <p>In the future, I might incorporate Ursula K. Le Guin's philosophical perspective on technology into my approach to website and project development. By applying her insights, I aim to enhance my work and create more meaningful and transformative experiences.

        <p>In J.R.R. Carpenter's essay "A Handmade Web," the author delves into a profound exploration of the value of crafting websites from scratch instead of relying on automated AI. The discussion begins with a brief historical overview of websites, tracing their evolution from the mid to late 1990s when the internet became a global phenomenon accessible to all. During this era, websites were meticulously created with meticulous attention to detail and care.

         <p>Within JR's writing, a prominent theme that captivated my attention was the significance attributed to self-made websites. In an era where automation and industrialization increasingly shape the internet, favoring mass consumption over artistic expression, these websites serve as a symbol of rebellion against the prevailing status quo.

        <p>During today's class, we were assigned to read Frank Chimero's talk titled "The Good Room," which was presented at the Substans Conference. In his talk, Chimero emphasizes the significance of technology and its transformation from a tool to an indispensable necessity in our daily lives in the modern era.</p>
         <p>Chimero argues that the internet, with its algorithmic processing, has the potential to entrap us online. He encourages us to take responsibility for this situation and reprogram our minds. To achieve this, he suggests using the New York Public Library as a resource. Chimero highlights that the library remains a place where individuals can maintain their identities, engage as genuine citizens, and participate actively in their communities.</p>
         <p>Additionally, Chimero provides an example from the 20th century to illustrate how one can create an environment that fosters self-agency and distances individuals from the addictive aspects of modern technology. He proposes embracing electricity, high-speed internet, and books but rejecting social media, cable TV, and microwaves. By making these choices, individuals can prioritize self-agency and lead more fulfilling lives.</p>
