        <p>This artwork aims to convey the destructive emotion of envy. The piece features green highlights and lettering, which traditionally represent envy and greed. The glowing eye and talking bolts symbolize the hatred that envious individuals may express, while the text floating in the open skull represents the confusion and animosity that runs through the mind of a jealous person.</p>
