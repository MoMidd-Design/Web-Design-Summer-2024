        <p>In this artwork, I was assigned the task of creating a visual representation of the "Godhead," which refers to the holy trinity of the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit. The aspect of the Son is symbolized by the Cross, the Holy Spirit is represented by the Dove, and the Crown and Hand are used to represent God or the Father.</p>
