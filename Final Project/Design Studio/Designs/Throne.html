        <p>This artwork's purpose is not to depict the physical appearance of a throne but rather to convey its symbolic meaning. The staircase symbolizes ascension or a higher state of existence, a common depiction of individuals sitting on thrones. In contrast, the golden orb overlapping the smaller hollow circle represents the futility of decadence. It suggests that people placed on thrones are often perceived as enlightened or glorious, but in reality, they are ordinary individuals or beings. The pillars on the sides serve to frame the piece and simultaneously reflect the decorative elements of a temple.</p>
