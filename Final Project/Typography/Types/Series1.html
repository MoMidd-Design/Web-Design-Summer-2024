        <p>My artistic expression highlights the negative aspects of capitalism that I find concerning. The low threshold and grasping hands reaching towards the glowing dollar symbolize the universal pursuit of wealth under this system. It is as if the goal of financial success is constantly held at a lofty height, figuratively and literally, creating a sense of perpetual striving.</p>
