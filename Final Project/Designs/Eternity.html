        <p>At the heart of the artwork, the eye symbolizes the all-seeing gaze of a divine entity. The word "perpetuity" is creatively distorted and arranged in a spiral pattern around the central eye. The artwork aims to evoke the concept of eternity by presenting a visually striking and thought-provoking composition. It challenges viewers to grapple with its alien and unusual appearance, inviting them to engage in a deeper contemplation of the concept it represents.</p>
