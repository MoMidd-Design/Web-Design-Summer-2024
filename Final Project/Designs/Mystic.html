        <p>This artwork visually depicts the concept of mysticism using typography. The phrase "As Above, So Below" in the center of the artwork is derived from Hermeticism and suggests that events on Earth or in the material world are reflective of the spiritual world, including heaven and hell. This concept aligns with the theme of mysticism, which involves the study and practice of self-reflection as a means to achieve closeness to God. The opposing figures in the artwork represent the contrasting aspects of ascension and damnation encountered during a spiritual journey.</p>
