        <p>The artwork aims to visually embody my idea of humanizing the city through "third places" â€”spaces designed for relaxation and recreational activities beyond work or isolation at home. The interconnected hands signify camaraderie among city dwellers, particularly within the urban setting. The blue text was deliberately selected for its contrast with the underlying black text and the central black-and-white image, creating a visually striking composition.</p>
