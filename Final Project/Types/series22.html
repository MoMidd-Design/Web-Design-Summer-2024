        <p>This piece was created using Photoshop and a new 3D modeling technique I specifically learned to make the typography and graphics stand out and resemble chrome metal. The phrase "Bow To No One" is intended to be rebellious and aggressive, representing the overall design aesthetic. The silver grills and fangs further enhance this theme, resulting in a cohesive and impactful poster.</p>
